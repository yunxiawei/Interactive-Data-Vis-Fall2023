    <h1>Interactive Data Visualization Final Project</h1>
    <h2>
      I'm visualizing diverse facets of the art world, using datasets
      encompassing artists' nationalities, genders, and departmental
      representation. I'm using these graphs to show the colorful mix of
      nationalities in art, the numbers of male and female artists, and which
      types of art are most popular. I'm doing this because I want everyone to
      see how diverse and exciting art can beâ€”like a colorful map showing where
      artists are from and what they create!

    <h2>
      Data Clean: I filtered out rows containing empty gender or nationality
      information, retaining only the entries with filled values.

    <!-- Nationalities by Gender -->
    <h2 style="color: blue">
      1. Nationalities by Gender (Bar Chart): This visualization provides a
      comprehensive overview of artists' nationalities distributed by gender.
      Through a bar chart representation, it showcases the count of artists from
      diverse nationalities categorized by gender. It presents the gender-based
      distribution of artists across different nationalities, enabling a quick
      understanding of the gender composition within various cultural contexts.

    <!-- Treemap by Nationalities -->
    <h2 style="color: purple">
      2. Treemap by Nationalities (Treemap Visualization): The treemap
      visualization illustrates the distribution of artists' nationalities,
      offering the flexibility to filter by gender. It presents a hierarchical
      display where the sizes of the rectangles indicate the count of artists,
      grouped by nationality. It aims to provide an interactive exploration of
      artists' nationalities, allowing users to analyze the gender distribution
      within each nationality category and gain insights into the proportional
      representation of different nationalities.
